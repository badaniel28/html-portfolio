    <h1>The Best Movies According to Bernadine</h1>
    <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>Damsel</h3>
    <p>The Netflix film Damsel is a solid film with a perfect duration and visuals that rival any big-screen production.</p>
    <h3>The Equalizer 3</h3>
    <p>Of all the movies and trilogy I have ever seen, it is the most amazing and flawless balance of good and evil. The Camorra or Italian mafia are the ideal antagonists for Robert McCall, the Equalizer, despite the extreme and graphic nature of the violence. The cinematography and location are simply amazing.</p>
    <h3>Heart of Stone</h3>
    <p>There are several poignant moments in the film that will captivate audiences and compel them to follow the characters on their journey.</p>
